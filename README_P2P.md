# P2P

Steam supports P2P. In this connectivity context. Hosts may not initially know the IP Addresses of their peers. Additionally, Their ISP Network Addresses it's own translation. Thus, the End-User may not even know their own public IP address and may not even have a public IP that Valve's hosts can be able to send to the End-User via inbound traffic. Furthermore, ICE is the global standard of protocol discovery and sharing. With this negotiation being the establishment directory system connection of fallback relays via satellite.

## On 'Free & Open Source'

So, since Steam supports P2P with connectivity layouts utilizing NAT's upon it's own translation. The End-User does not know their IP is connected via third-party IP's, hosts, and is rewrited through a trap-wire ICE standardized protocol discovery mechanism and sharing negotiation established with system feedback information loops with a relay satellite connection registry.

_Gabe does not want to use Datagram Transport Layer Security,  transport layer network protocols  or Web Real Time Comm's channels for mining data. The alternative being, in particular, conjuring up an internet task force of PCP implementation not used by Valve's current standard of ABC._

### Symmetric connect mode

In general, Steam offers UID features _symmetric connection modes using P2P_. ISP's, servers, hosts, and established sockets connection between each fine grained fiber optic line trap-wired through the initiating transfer connector cables at the same time.


**Race Conditions** - When hackers bypass authentication, decrypt sensitive data, and exploit ICE roles, it can be tricky for Gabe and his team of Software Experts to sort out race conditions. Namely, producing single connector handlers via the SteamAPI known as `k_ESteamNetworkingConfig_SYmmetricConnect_FLAG`

**ISteam** - In most P2P libs systems like the ones in GoogleWebRTC, Gabe's connection oriented talks to peers will first establish a system implementation with a robust and seamlessly transparent messaging handler. Much of Gabe's code is based on the End User's datagram protocols (UDP). Specifically attuned with packets sent via linted IP addresses for the intended recipient. For example: 

`sentto(), recvfrom()`

<img src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.yeTSE3YZI5Sc3d5XxcuW0gHaEK&amp;pid=Api" alt="What is NAT in Networking | How NAT works | Advantages and ..."/>

This was built by Gabe in collaboration with the Valve Software team during the development of Steam, with the goal of facilitating ad hoc interface and P2P in order to support pre-existing programs. All that truly matters is the degree of abstraction that the end-user receives from their ISP. Working directly with ISP providers would be far easier, but leveraging ISteam makes code modification much simpler. Creating a new connection every time a packet is sent is preferable on these lower-level abstraction maintainence activity connectors. Gabe therefore invented the symmetric-mode. mandating first handshakes via autonomous idle connection nodes that close when NaN is detected between each partner. 

**What does this require?**

<img src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.Y0T6aXy2uv40TO4pbIz1-wHaDW&amp;pid=Api" alt="Steam Socket を使用する | Unreal Engine ドキュメント"/>

It requires libraries of several prerequisites. Noteably, SteamAPI's provider servicer. Which is used for games. So, make sure you're from Ivy League.

**Radio Signal Channels**

Relaying messages from hosts must be constant with ISP from the End-User capable of pushing messages...

**Steam Network**

Valve supports plug-ins with signallers that service requirements based on pre-placed relative miniscule satellites. This means fewer than MG's in pixelated `IP_MTU` format. And one datagram delivery is all that's needed. Tolerance levels must be handled properly to avoid anomalous negotiation mechanisms. Gabe will inform the system when one connection is disrupted. Speaking of:

1. Bandwidth
2. Latency
3. Handshakes
4. Exchanges
5. Connectors

_These channels must be low but high when there is a burst of exchanges created from silent detectors. Unless, something changes._

<hr>

* STUN server - Interactive Connectivity Establishment, Session Initiation Protocol, Real Time Communicator....
* Firewall - Helps block unwanted connections.
* P2P Discovery - Supports public IP Addresses to open up firewalls..
* Relay Establishment - Relative bandwidth with publicly available servers...
* Relay Host - NAT piercing is a technique to pair multiple hosts with traffic.
* ICE Protocol - Traverses relays using global NATs.
* TURN/STUN Servers - Relay packets because the server is public and exposing packets that costs ISP's bandwidth.

Ultimately, the End-User will need to decide what devices will be allowed connector nodes via global satellite mechanisms and whether or not to allow pierced NAT's within their home network. Steam will customize relay services via Valve Datagram Relay transfers with pluggable business partners. (B2B, P2P). SDR will use a method of networking relays to communicate on the backbone of Gabe's opensource code. Anyway Steam will relay raffic but at the same time, now share IP Addresses with other peers that may be malicious. Which brings this to the next segway:

## Named Hosts A.K.A Matchmaking

Before the End-User makes the fateful decision to build their `$2500 eGBNC, qSA, pre-formatted MSFT WIN_PC with kernel firewall subsystems built in C` consider who (You) are connecting, and are pre-connected too. But, even before that, the End-User must find a way to assign themselves an identity via hosting. (Which means, Verify Identity Loops, Matchmaking services, library scopes, etc.) The transporter is Gabe, Steam is the authenticator of your identity using B2B, P2P, NAT, and other acronyms.... ~~Assuming you have all of those requirements, you can use SteamNetworkingSockets to make P2P connections!~~ ICE uses pre-supported, pre-compiled, pre-built project files to set this up for you:

```cpp
# Src file
cmake_min_require(V-9.9)
[dat_con](firewall_dat_con LANG C)

add_exe(firewall_exe
 src/main.c
 src/net.c
 src/decomp.c
 src/map
 src/jQuery
 src/eslint
 src/JSON
 src/univorn
 src/sql
 src/etc
)
cmake -DUSE_STEAMWEBRTC=ON
include_git/gnu/repo/dir(
 include
 /usr/inc/libcap
 /usr/desktop/bin
 /usr/desktop/map
 /usr/desktop/cors
 /usr/desktop/app
 /usr/desktop/pkg
)

target_link_libs(firewall_exe
 pcap
 bin
 pkg
 man
 docs
 src
 vim
 cmd
 control
 map
)
```

The End-User activates their setup supporting these specific source files to be compiled via Networking Sockets. Provided by `Steam`, two additional `git ISteamNetworkingSocket, NAT, UDP, P2P modulus -pull { GOOGL_WEBRTC.cpp} [dat_con]` Because, these files will be included in the containers subdirectory filesystem components with the retro-fitted driver header file that will then link the external requirements as is necessary. Consider the interface the End-User will use for implementing signals via their ISP. Setting up the Google Server is trivial, and so is the client. For these are pre-coded in `C++, Go`. Between these networking peers via the `libpcap` analysis. Steam will decompress these using `zlib` or `bzip2`. This makes connecting with just a few exchange of messages publicly available via the `ABC_STUN, GOOGL_TURN` platforming the specific devices with `cmakelist.txt` modular in design and broken down into portable organizations. Such as, pluggble maintainers or third-party testers. For example:

```cpp
plugin_exe.cpp
PROCESS_PEER_START
...
find_pkg
target_link_libs(firewall_exe ${PCAP_LIBS})
$
  log_write(LOG_STDOUT, "%s version %s ( %s )\n", datCY_NAME, DATCY_VERSION, DATCY_URL);$
  log_write(LOG_STDOUT, "Platform: %s\n", STEAM_PLATFORM);$
  log_write(LOG_STDOUT, "Compiled with:");$
  for (i = 0; i < with.size(); i++)$
    log_write(LOG_STDOUT, " %s", with[i].c_str());$
  log_write(LOG_STDOUT, "\n");$
  log_write(LOG_STDOUT, "Compiled without:");$
  for (i = 0; i < without.size(); i++)$
    log_write(LOG_STDOUT, " %s", without[i].c_str());$
  log_write(LOG_STDOUT, "\n");$
  log_write(LOG_STDOUT, "Available nsock engines: %s\n", nsock_list_engines());$
}$
```

The pluggable writing standards for opensource varies and the protocols can become complex. So, this should just be used for signaling. [XMPP](https://xmpp.org/) which is a LAN beacon support, so that P2P connections can be made even when signaling is down or the hosts do not have Internet connectivity.
